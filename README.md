Messaging web forum for music lovers

musify.sql is the database that contains and manages all the information about the users of musify.

The rest of files are .php files that build the structure of the web-interface. Here are some functionalities of musify:

  - Access to the website through user and password.
  - Messaging system: from one to all (public messages), from one to one (private messages), from one to group (group             messages).
  
  - When the user enters the application, he/she can read the messages sent to his/her profile and all the public messages.
  - There should be a user profile based on the preferred type of music and age.
  
  - Each group is defined by a type of music and a range of ages of its members.
  - With this information, an administrator (through a separate web page) must be able to register groups.
  - When the user enters the application, he/she must also read all the messages addressed to the groups to which they belong.
